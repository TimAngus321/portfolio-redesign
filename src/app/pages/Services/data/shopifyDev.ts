          Themes. It is possible to create your own custom storefront using Shopify Hydrogen however this is normally
          for people who have a very distinct vision of what they want the design of their store to be. If you don't fall
          into this category your frontend is going to be a Shopify theme. Working on Shopify themes is a unique development
          experience and requires expereince to develop them in a maintainable manner. Creating a proper coding environment
          using Github, Themekit and Shopify's CLI will allow for a more manageable developer experience. Shopify's Theme
          Development uses traiditional frontend languages and the templating language Liquid to get data from your
          store. It's possible to create new sections that you can use normally in your theme editor and using Shopify
          Proxy to make API calls to your backend.`,
