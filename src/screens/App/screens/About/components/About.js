            I am a Le Wagon alumni that learnt full-stack development with the
            Rails framework. Since then I have continued delving deeper into
            Javascript and building projects with React and stores Shopify.
            <br />
            <br />
            After working as full-stack developer at the digital agency Merconic
            and the US based company MilkRun I have used technology stacks for
            the frontend and backend. To see what technologies I use{" "}

            When Iâ€™m not coding I love travelling, making and listening to
            music, Rock climbing, running and biking.
            <br />
            <br />
            To keep my mind sharp I enjoy reading news and dev articles, novels
            and watching documenteries (not just about coding!){" "}
