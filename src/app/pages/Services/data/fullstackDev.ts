    desc: `Full stack development encompasses the complete process of application software development, covering both
    frontend and backend development. The front end consists of the user interface (or UI), and the back end handles
    the business logic and application workflows that run behind the scenes. Full stack developers possess the skills and
    knowledge to work across the entire technology stack, enabling seamless user experiences and developing robust backends.

        desc: `For web apps Full-Stack I use frameworks like Next, Nuxt and Ruby on Rails. These are fantastic
        options that have everything you need to create robust full-stack apps. Next and Nuxt uses React and Vue 
        Components to build user interfaces, and Next and Nuxt offers additional backend features and optimizations.
        Ruby on Rails is  different instead of a component based structure Rails uses Model, View and Controller (MVC)
        approach and is also a great option. If desired I can swap out Rails frontend and use React instead.`,

        your frontend and backend. For example you may have apps for mobile, browsers and desktop that all need data
        from your database. In this situation it makes sense to have a separate backend so you can use the same APIs
        to pull data from your database to all your different apps. This is just an example but there are many other
        reasons for why you might want to seperate your frontend and backend.`,
