      and has 3rd party apps for anything Shopify hasn't covered. You don't need too much technical experience to set 
      up and run a Shopify store however there are times you will want certain features, functionality, 
      control or additional oversight that Shopify doesn't provide out of the box. This is where a developer comes
      in. Depending on what you want to change will depend on what servies you require.`,

          will need and have peace of mind knowing that your store will be set up well by an experiences professional, 
          look no further. We will have an initial consultation regarding the needs of your store and then I can provide
          an action plan for what you'd need for your store. I will then handle the store setup and any backend 
          infrastucture or 3rd party tools that you will need for your store to work as you need.`,

          Shopify's frontend. When talking about the frontend of Shopify store we're almost always refering to Shopify 
          Themes. It is possible to create your own custom storefront using Shopify Hydrogen however this is normally
          for people who have a very distinct vision of what they want the design of their store to be. If you don't fall
          into this category your frontend is going to be a Shopify theme. Working on Shopify themes is a unique development
          experience and requires expereince to develop them in a maintainable manner. Creating a proper coding environment
          using Github, Themekit and Shopify's CLI will allow for a more manageable developer experience. Shopify's Theme
          Development uses traiditional frontend languages and the templating language Liquid to get data from your
          store. It's possible to create new sections that you can use normally in your theme editor and using Shopify
          Proxy to make API calls to your backend.`,

          I have experience with this and know where to find up to date information and how to test for changes. I can 
          offer Shopify apps using Ruby and Node which is perfect as they're also well supported by Shopify iteslf.
