    desc: `UI/UX Development covers a comprehensive range of technical and design-focused areas. 
    On the technical side, it encompasses frontend development which includes responsive design 
    to ensure applications work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes. The design 
    aspect involves creating and implementing user interfaces that follow established design principles. 
    This includes typography, colour theory, layout composition, and working with design tools like 
    Figma, Framer and other no code tools. UI/UX developers deeply understand visual hierarchy, spacing 
    and how to create consistent, branded experiences. The user experience portion focuses on the 
    psychology of user behaviour and interaction design. This involves information architecture, user 
    flow mapping, wireframing, prototyping, and ensuring intuitive navigation patterns. Accessibility 
    is a crucial component, making sure applications are usable by people with different abilities and needs.
    It also includes performance optimisation, user research, usability testing, and implementing analytics 
    to measure user engagement and behaviour as well as using current design trends, web standards, and best 
    practices while maintaining a balance between aesthetic appeal and functional efficiency.`,
