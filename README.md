## ToDo

- New animations replace css transitions with framer motion in skills page ✅
- Redo routes in a more traditional manner ✅
- Optimize Images ✅
- Update parallax scroll ✅
- Update so it's a progressive web app ✅
- Clean up code with typescript, code splitting with custom hooks, SCSS modules & more ✅
- Use react-colour-extractor package to add cool effect on skills page ✅
- Replace react-color-extractor package with node-vibrant for full control ✅
- Add limiter for abstract email validator API (don't allow more than 1 request a sec) ✅
- Replace min/max height & width with clamp() for better basic responsiveness ⚙️
- Animate page transitions
- Have skill card animations loop round continuously rather than reverse

## Possible Improvement Ideas

- Carousel skillset selector for mobile version of skills page
- Investigate errors for firefox on Skills Page
- Remove styled and use scss module for hamburger menu and burger (redo?)
- Check process state of skills animation with useContext everywhere to prevent errors when skill page skillSet buttons used too quickly
- Replace home page animation with interactive framer motion gradient blob
- GSAP might be a better animation library for more complex animations as it's more consise and clean Framer Motion seems better for simple animations.
