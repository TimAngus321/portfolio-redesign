            I am a Le Wagon alumni that learnt full-stack development with the
            Rails framework. Since then I have continued delving deeper into
            Javascript and building projects with React and Shopify.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've worked fulltime as a full-stack developer for the digital agency Merconic
            and the US based company MilkRun as well as freelance for various clients. 
            I have used a variety technology stacks for frontend and backend projects.

            When Iâ€™m not coding I love travelling, making and listening to
            music, Rock climbing, running, biking and watching films.

            <br />
            To keep my mind sharp I enjoy reading news, dev articles, novels
            and watching documenteries.{" "}
