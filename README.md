- Make first PWA

- Framer Motion
- Abstract API
- React Dancing Lines

## ToDo
- Add box shadow/glow effect to skill page animation.
- Add design skills in skills section
- For mobile add the correct units for height that take into consideration the nav bar for mobile browsers
- Add select for contact to help users select relevant servies ⚙️
- Use grid instead of flexbox for basic layout (it's more robust)
- Move notifications from useEmail hook to it's own hook so it's more readable
- Make more resuable components
- Use more conventional react structure
- Create a carousel for sliderBtns for services and skill pages

## Add to next Version

- Add next JS/React Server Side Components
- Progress bar on background color of button (like netflix next episode btn) while animation runs on skills page
- Use cookies instead of localStorage to set expiry easily
- Carousel skillset selector for mobile version of skills page
- Replace home page animation with interactive framer motion gradient blob

## Improvement Ideas

- Investigate errors for firefox on Skills Page - Looks like base64 error from the svg icons that firefox/node vibrant can't process (png files in firefox work fine) - temp fix implemented ⚙️
- Check quality of images for work page. Looks like they got a bit blury/grainy after optimisation.
- Check process state of skills animation with useContext everywhere to prevent errors when skill page skillSet buttons used too quickly - unecessary
