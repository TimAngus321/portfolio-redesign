    have a consultation. This is so we can go over the details of your project to figure out what your development needs 
    are, what services you need and if I'm the right fit for your project. The decisions you make regarding your project's
    environment, tech stack and infrastructure are vital to allow you to develop, iterate and grow quickly without issue.
    If you're unsure about your development needs it's essential that you contact an experienced developer like myself so
    we can ensure your project is a success.`,
